# hello-world
 This is my Repository to try new things with GitHub.

 Like learning how to format in Markdown. For instance using **bold text** or *italicized text*.

 Furthermore `code snippets` might be fun or using tables like this one:

 | Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |

I might come back to this later.
